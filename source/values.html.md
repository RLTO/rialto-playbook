# Company values

## Continuous Improvement
We recognize that we can always be better. Therefore, we have strong opinions, loosely held, and take initiative to improve ourselves, the company, and our community.

This is a never-ending task, because there is always room for improvement. This week should be better than last, and we should be optimistic that next week will be better than this week. We learn new things, and share those things with our peers and community.

## Honesty
While we are cognizant of people's feelings, and seek to work with each other constructively, we cannot let those concerns get in the way of our happiness and the success of our work. We'd rather be too honest than too polite.

## Transparency

We avoid having private conversations about each other or the project. Instead, we talk in person, and use tools such as Slack and GitHub to communicate openly within a project. Our shared knowledge should'nt be lost in your inbox or forgotten at the end of a meeting.

Everyone has a different style of communication - in a flat organization as ours, anyone is to be included, be it in online and offline interactions.

## Collaboration
Working with, learning from, helping and having fun with the team as well as with our clients and partners will define the success of our solutions. Any problem is a solution-in-waiting- the entire team are there to help you find it.

## Staying lean
Always challenge yourself and your team to think of the simplest first steps to get to a larger goal. Define hypotheses. Ship fast. Test everything. Measure what you have to. Discard what doesn’t work and improve on what does. This will allow us to create working, maintainable, and understandable software that is enjoyable and easy to use.

## Global
Our company got founded in an era defined by globalization. But the level of information, talent and success will be subject to local circumstances. We’re building a company culture which unites a multi-local sourcing and product roll-out.
Our company culture allows for personal diversity. Be yourself, hold firm to your personal beliefs.
